Work with JS events

Examples of functions for working with events in js

1. By hovering a link at the end of its text, its href value is added in parentheses, and the link text is replaced with the value of the title attribute, after which this event is unbound.

2.Text input displays the value of the value attribute to the console when you click on any of them, but only on the first click. Pressing the input again does not cause any non-standard reaction.

3.By clicking on a paragraph, a square of the number that it contains appears in it. The event fires once.

4. When the focus is lost, the input checks its contents for the correct number of characters. How many characters should be in the input is indicated in the data-length attribute. If the correct quantity is entered, then the border (border) of the input becomes green, if it is incorrect - red.
